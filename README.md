# Coding Resources

## Description

- Google is our friend, and provides many resources and answers we need in a short amount of time, but sometimes we need a place where we can consolidate our resources into a single webpage.
- I made a simple coding resources website for the average programmer to quickly scroll and find the resource/documentation they need for a specific section in their code.
- Now, all of the resources I need can be seen in one simple website.

## Installation

No installation is needed. Access via [Gitpages](https://epicasino.github.io/Coding-Resources/) link.

ðŸ† The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here. -->
