# Coding Resources

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/github/license/epicasino/Coding-Resources)

## Description

- Google is our friend, and provides many resources and answers we need in a short amount of time, but sometimes we need a place where we can consolidate our resources into a single webpage.
- I made a simple coding resources website for the average programmer to quickly scroll and find the resource/documentation they need for a specific section in their code.
- Now, all of the resources I need can be seen in one simple website.
- Built in NextJS, deployed with Vercel.

## Features

- A 'Sections' dropdown with all main resource sections to quickly select a topic.
- Search bar feature to make resources more readily available.
- ~~A 'Open Dropdowns' button to open all resource sections at once.~~ (Currently in progress for NextJS!)
- ~~A 'Scroll to Top' button to make site navigation easier.~~ (Currently in progress for NextJS!)

## Installation

No installation is needed. Access via [Vercel](https://coding-resources.vercel.app/) link.

## Credits

**Thank you Jeff for helping out with the search function!**
